# string is a data in python

# string is immutable data type which means we can't change the string after it created in python

# we can create the string using double quotes("") and single quotes('')

# in python index starts from zero(0)

name = 'Ravindra singh';
# name = "Ravindra singh";
# print(name)

#print(len(name)) # len(string_name) is used to find the length of the string
# we can print the each character of the string using the square brackets([])  
# print(name[3]);

print(name[0:]) # it works as print(name[0:length-1])

print(name[:]) # it returns the same string 

print(name[:14]) #it works as the print(name[0:length-1])

# String slicing
# print(name[0:4]); #we can get the substring using the braackets[index_start:index_End ] in this last index doesn't include (length-1)

# in string reverse indexing also available the index starts from the -1 (not really used)
# print(name[-4:-1]); #(position-4:position-1)
