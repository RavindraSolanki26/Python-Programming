
# In Python, a tuple is an immutable sequence type, which means once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed, added, or removed.

# num = (1,2,3,4);
# num2 = (1,2,3,4);

#a = () # a empty tuple
#num[3] =90; #it gives error because we're trying to change the tuple values and tuple is immutable datatype

# print(num)
# s = (1,) #tuple with one value

#s = (1) #if we only write this then that it is not a tuple it is only a int value

# print(type(num))

# print(type(s));

# join two tuple

# num = (1,2,3,4);
# num2 = (1,2,5,3,4);

# num3 = num+num2;
# # print(num3)
